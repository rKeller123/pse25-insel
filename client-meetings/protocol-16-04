## Review last Ieration
**PaintingLayer + semi-working Rendering Pipeline**

*Feedback Waldo:* 

**seperated paintinglayer:**
we need to get the actor of the reslicer (initReslicer2D). The resliceMapper will give the exact position.
What we need to do is reproduce the actor and match.
Tipp: ask ClaudeAI 

**coloring smoothness:**
The coloring isn't smooth, because we don't have a buffer. 
We need a seperate handle class, which handles the painting, the class contains the code for the calculation, buffer.
This is done to avoid further code in another class and to have a clear presentation and better understanding of the code.

*TO DO:*
From the parent class: catch mousemovement and press, which is our object (all that .onMouseMove() should be moved)

## Still To Do
**Select color:** Focus on painting.

**Fixed radius**
Where on the UI do you want the radius changing?
S on Keyboard + Scroll on Mouse and add to the colorpicker a slide


## Till End of Iteration

1. paint on top of image
2. seperate class for coloring
