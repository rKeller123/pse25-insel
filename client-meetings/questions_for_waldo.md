# Questions for Waldo
this is a summary of questions we want to ask Waldo in the next meeting:

| who | question |
|---|---|
| Yanic | Implemented the dnd functionality using HOC pattern in order to make as little changes as possible in the existing codebase. Is this a good approach or do you see a possibility using the hook functionality of react-dnd without wrapping? |
| Yanic | Is the rgb in Colors.js a scaled version of RGB by the factor 1/255? If so, am I correct to assume that index 2 is an error? |
