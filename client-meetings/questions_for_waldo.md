# Questions for Waldo
this is a summary of questions we want to ask Waldo in the next meeting:

| who | question |
|---|---|
| Raphael&Yanic | We implemented the useDrop in ViewersContainer.js and call to handleLoad from FourViewer.js. Do you think this is a good solution regarding the expansion to more viewerContainers.js |
|Yanic| Is the rgb in Colors.js a scaled version of RGB by the factor 1/255? If so, am I correct to assume that index 2 is an error? |
