## Progress since last Meeting

**Feedback from Waldo:** Waldo was highly satisfied and visibly proud of the progress made.

*Problem:* when going out of the image.
His suggestion is to save the last coordinate, when going out.

## Next Iteration

**Still to do:**

*Synchronization with segmentation layer:*
Intensity volume and the segmentation volume, now we created a volume to paint
funciton that updates the volume with painting


A link with more Dicom files to download will be sent by Waldo.

**Goals:**

*Shortcuts:* 
Like a guide at the beginning.
Up to us.
