## Agenda

| #  | Topic |
|----|---------|
| 1  | **Introduction** |
|    | - Waldos team develops hospital software and lectures at uniBe. |
|    | - Provides software for 20 hospital groups, the only dedicated software team. |
|    | - Medical-blocks: Their development platform system. |
|    | - International projects: MB-Neuro, MB-Google, MB-UniBe. |
|    | - Hardware integration, server deployment. |
|    | - Focus on data management and cloud-based information systems. |
|    | - Developed a customized version of Jupyter Notebook. |
| 2  | **Current Project Status** |
|    | - Roger handled moving and calculating image data. |
|    | - Extracted planes from volume matrix images. |
|    | - Image interaction still needs implementation (React-based). |
|    | - Planned features: Brushing, coloring (segmentation), drag-and-drop images. |
| 3  | **Technologies** |
|    | - Cornerstone.js (region segmentation tool) |
|    | - Python, JavaScript, Node.js, React, GraphQL |
|    | - Full-stack implementation: Backend, frontend, database |
| 4  | **Next Steps** |
|    | - **Goal for 1st Iteration:** Understand the code. Map out frontend flow in PowerPoint/Flipchart. |
|    | - **Next Meeting:** 19.03.2025 + Planning for Iteration 2 |

### Project Goals
- Understand and enhance the existing codebase with
  - Painting/brushing fuctionality
  - drag&drop images into program

### Learning Outcomes
- Gain expertise in modern full-stack technologies.  
- Work at Waldo's office for hands-on programming support.  
- Regular **code reviews** by Waldo.

### Additional Information
- **MRI/CT**: Images stored in DICOM format, which includes metadata and patient details.
- **DICOM Metadata**: Contains two orientation vectors and extensive metadata.
- **Voxel**: The 3D equivalent of a pixel (x, y, z) in millimeters.
- **Copy Volume**: A transparent duplicate used for brushing/painting implementation.

### Chatbot Preferences
- **CloudAI** – Best for programming.  
- **Grok** – Decent.  
- **ChatGPT** – Good.

### Meeting Summary
- **Goal for 1st Iteration:** Understand the code.
- **Next Meeting:** 19.03.2025
